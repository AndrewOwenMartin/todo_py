## todo_py - A minimal CLI JSON-based task list.

### Instructions

Clone the repo to wherever you put applications. I put it in my home directory.

Create a task list file, it can be anywhere, and called anything, but it should contain simply a pair of square brackets.

###### my_tasks.json
```
[]
```

Either (i) put "todo.py" on your path, or (ii) use its relative or absolute path. E.g. ~/my_progs/todo_py/todo.py
